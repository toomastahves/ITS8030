Task 8: Finding edge peaks

Implement the function
find_peaks_image(image : np.ndarray, thres : float, in_place : bool = False) -> np.ndarray
to find the peaks of edge responses perpendicular to the edges. The edge magnitude and orientation
at each pixel are to be computed using the Sobel operators. The original image is again converted
into grayscale in the starter code. A peak response is found by comparing a pixel's edge magnitude
to that of the two samples perpendicular to the edge at a distance of one pixel, which requires the
bilinear_interpolation function
(Hint: You need to create an image of magnitude values at each pixel to send as input to the
interpolation function).
If the pixel's edge magnitude is e and those of the other two are e1 and e2, e must be larger than
"thres" (threshold) and also larger than or equal to e1 and e2 for the pixel to be a peak response.
Assign the peak responses a value of 255 and everything else 0. Compute e1 and e2 as follows:

(please check the separate task8.pdf)

To do: Find the peak responses in "virgintrains.jpg" with thres = 40.0 and save as "task8.png".
What would be a better value for thres?
