Task 3: Separable Gaussian blur

Implement the function

separable_gaussian_blur_image (image : np.ndarray, sigma : float, in_place : bool) -> np.ndarray

to Gaussian blur an image using separate filters. "sigma" is the standard deviation of the Gaussian.
The separable filter should first Gaussian blur the image horizontally, followed by blurring the
image vertically. Call the convolution function twice, first with the horizontal kernel and then with
the vertical kernel. Use the proper normalizing constant while creating the kernel(s) and then
normalize using the given normalize_kernel() function before convolution. The final image should be
identical to that of gaussian_blur_image.

To do: Gaussian blur the image "songfestival.jpg" using this function with a sigma of 4.0, and save as "task3.png".
